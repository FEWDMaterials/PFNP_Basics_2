{"home":{"content":"# Programming For Non-Programmers\n---\n\nHello, Wrold! Welcome to class. Today and tomorrow, we will take a small dip into the world of web programming. \n\n## Main Goals\n---\n1. Learn key concepts and terminology of the industry.\n2. Understand how the web works on a high level\n3. Learn the basics of HTML/CSS\n\n\n## Game Plan\n---\n\n* ## [Essential Terminology](#essential-terminology)\n* ## [Setting Up Your Environment](#setting-up-your-environment)\n* ## [Guts of an HTTP Request](#guts-of-an-http-request)\n* ## [Deploying to the internets](#deploying-to-the-internets)\n* ## [HTML Basics](#html-basics)\n* ## [Semantic HTML](#semantic-html)\n* ## [Practical CSS3 Guidelines](#practical-css3-guidelines)\n* ## [Frontend Frameworks](#frontend-frameworks)\n\n","idx":0},"title":{"content":"PFNP - The Basics","idx":1},"desc":{"content":"A crash course on web development.","idx":2},"essential-terminology":{"content":"# Essential Terminology\n---\n\n**Learning Objective**: Learn the essential words and concepts that are used on a daily basis by engineers and project/product managers on the job.\n\n---\n\nHere are some words and concepts that will hopefully give you a more holistic view of the more technical aspects of the industry. \n\n## Define: Program\n---\nDiscrete, highly logical and explicit instructions that are parsed and executed by a computer.\n\nWe call this set of human-readable instructions **source code**, or colloquially, a **computer program**.\n\n**Compilers** can take this source code and transform it into **machine code**, a representation of the source that can be executed by the computer's **central processing unit** or **CPU**. \n\nNot all programs are compiled though, some are **interpreted**. The difference is that compiled languages need a step where the source code is physically transformed into machine code. However, with an interpreted language, this additional step is **excluded** in favor of **parsing** and **executing** the source code directly when the program is run.\n\n## How programs are written\n---\n\nAll programs are composed with a collection of **fundamental** concepts that, when combined, can essentially dictate a wide variety of tasks a computer can perform.\n\nHere are a collection of these most important concepts:\n\n* **Declarations**: typically, we can store and retrieve data in our programs by associating them with intermediary values that we call **variables**\n* **Expressions**: we use expressions to evaluate stuff. For example, **`2 + 2`** is an example of an expression that will **evaluate** a value, namely 4. \n* **NOTE**: typically we can use expressions and declarations in tandem to perform complex tasks. For instance, we can reference a variable we declared in an expression to help us evaluate new values which can then be stored.\n* **Statements**: statements will use expressions and declarations to alternate a program's **control flow**, which is essentially the order in which declarations, expressions, and other statements are executed.\n\nAside from these fundamental concepts, we also talk a lot about this idea of **algorithms**. An **algorithm** is simple a series of declarations, expressions, and statements that can be used over and over again to solve well defined problems of a certain type.\n\nFor example, we can implement an algorithm that converts temperature from **fahrenheit** to **celsius**. It would look something like this:\n\n1. **Declare** F = 32;\n2. **Expression** ( **F** - 32 ) / 1.8;\n3. **Declare** C = **Evaluated** expression from **[2]**\n\nThis is a form of **pseudo** code where we define the steps a computer program &mdash; **any** &mdash; computer program can take to convert **fahrenheit** to **celsius**.\n\nThe beauty of programming is that all of it revolves around the same key set of concepts and ideas. For this reason, we do not need to specify any **particular programming language** when discussing the functional aspects of a program.\n\n## Define: Programming languages\n---\n\nA programming language is a series of **grammar** and **rules** that we can define towards writing source code.\n\nLanguages are effectively different approaches towards communicating the same ideas in programming. Essentially, we can communicate in say both **French** and **English**, what mainly differs is the structure of our sentences and the actual words and sounds themselves.\n\nThe **same analogy** can be made with programming languages.\n\n## Examples of programming languages\n---\n\nThere are many. Way too many. \n\nHere are some of the most popular ones, though.\n\n1. **JavaScript**: this language is interpreted.\n2. **Python**: this language is interpreted.\n3. **Java**: this language is compiled\n4. **Ruby**: this language is interpreted.\n5. **C/C++**: this language is compiled.\n\nThese languages all build on the same concepts defined above; the main difference lies in **how** they are run (compiled vs interpreted) and also **how** they are used. \n\nIn general, anything programmable can be programmed in each of the languages defined above. However, some languages are better suited for certain tasks above others. \n\nFor example, to perform web programming on the front-end, you'll want to write JavaScript. This is because all browsers collectively support running javascript within it's environment. \n\n## What is web development?\n---\nThe use of programming languages and concepts towards producing a system that listens to user requests over the internet and serves back HTML, CSS, and interaction code to the client.\n\n## What is the difference between a web site and web app\n---\nWeb sites are more **static**. Think of them as sort of like interactive brochures. They typically don't hold any state and are usually just information.\n\nA web app is more like an iOS or Android app. It holds state, does not refresh itself and in general **does something** vs **showing something**.\n\n## What are the stages of web development\n---\n\nDepends on the methodology used by team. Typically, there is a UX phase, a Design phase, a Development phase bundled with extensive QA. This was the process used in the consulting firm I used to work in.\n\nFor a startup, the process is similar, however there is a lot more room for iteration and testing out ideas by putting something up for users to use and deliver feedback.\n\n## What is the difference between front-end and back-end web development\n---\n**Front end**: Client side interactions and structure. This includes stuff like iOS apps and whatever you load in browser.\n\n**Back end**: Server side, data storage and retrival. Needs a client **of some sort** (not necessarily a browser) to work. Deals with storing and retriving information.\n\n## Main Class Deliverable\n---\n\nIn order to explore the core concepts of this class and achieve our learning objectives, we will recreate the **traditional resume template** for the web.\n\n## Key Requirements\n---\n\n* Template should resemble the typical resume.pdf we all maintain\n* Template should use tasteful CSS3 styles to accentuate key peices of information and design principles\n* Template should work across all screens including (and specifically) mobile\n* Template should be **printer friendly** and take up exactly one page  when printed. \n\nHere is an **[example](http://resume.taqquikarim.com/)**.\n\n<!--\n**IMPORTANT**: These definitions are **intentionally** super lightweight. Best way to learn programming concepts is by actually programming. You will pick up a vastly larger number of concepts and vocabulary when we start building websites from scratch. For this reason, I tried to keep this portion of the class as minimal as possible.\n\n## What can you build with various languages?\n---\nBasically, anything. You can use programming languages to configure hardware, build websites, build mobile apps, desktop programs, server monitoring systems. Literally, anything.\n\n## What is web development?\n---\nThe use of programming languages and concepts towards producing a system that listens to user requests over the internet and serves back HTML, CSS, and interaction code to the client.\n\n## What is the difference between a web site and web app\n---\nWeb sites are more **static**.

Then, we will set up tools and resources needed to write code.\n\n### Setting up your classroom environment\n---\nPlease set up a **[GitHub](https://www.github.com)** account. **Make sure you also verify your email** after setting up your account.\n\nI have developed a suite of tools that we will use in class to make our lives easier.\n\n\n### [Autosync](http://autosync.io/#/course/Taq/0)\nLive class notes. For the duration of the class, all code written on my machine will be available to you in _real time_ via [Autosync](http://autosync.io/#/course/Taq/0).\n\n### [GitBot](http://gitbot.co/#home)\nWe will use [GitBot](http://gitbot.co/#home) to deploy our webpages to the internets. You will need this in class, for homework, and generally in life.\n\n### [Samantha](http://fewd.us/samantha/)\nSamantha is an online coding environment. We will learn javascript in [Samantha](http://fewd.us/samantha/) + it is super useful for doing quick experiments / during office hours. \n\n...There are more, but for now, these should suffice. Check out some of my writings on tools and such on my [Medium page](https://medium.com/@the_taqquikarim/).\n\n### Setting up your code environment\n---\n\nBefore we can begin our exercises in wizardry, we must download and install a few relevant programs.\n\nThese programs are going to help us write code, transfer code to servers, and view the results of our code in the browser.\n\n## Sublime Text\n\n[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) &mdash; code editor &mdash; you'll be writing code here. This is a free tool, but they will ask you to donate every few saves. However, you can use the program for free as long as you'd like.\n\n## Chrome\n[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) &mdash; web browser &mdash; you'll use this to view your code assignments. So free it hurts.","idx":4},"guts-of-an-http-request":{"content":"# Guts of an HTTP Request\n---\n\n**Learning objective**: Understand how HTTP, or the HyperText Transfer Protocol, works.\n\n---\n\n## Question \nWhat happens when you type in [http://www.google.com](http://www.google.com) into your URL bar?\n\n## As it turns out, a whole lot.\n\n1. Chrome has no idea what [http://www.google.com](http://www.google.com) actually means, so first, it looks up the **IP Address** for Google.\n2. **DNS**, or **Domain Name System**, is a phone book containing IP Addresses for all the websites that exist on the internet.\n3. Chrome then sends an **HTTP Request** to the IP address associated with Google. An HTTP Request is essentially a text message asking Google for data.\n4. Google's **server** will issues a server **Response** back to your browser. This response is parsed by Chrome (ie: should Chrome display this response data? download it? etc)\n5. **???**\n6. Profit.\n\n## Ok great, why do we care?\n\nThere are a few key insights to take away here.\n\nFirst and foremost, the main communication mechanism for the internet &mdash; you know, that thing that rules our lives &mdash; is **text**. Literally just **letters and words and numbers and characters**.\n\nThe other main point to take away here is this: the text that is transferred is written in a highly specific manner. It follows a very strict set of rules that can be parsed and understood by the server and the browser. In other words, this text follows a **specific set of grammatical rules**.\n\nThis set of grammar is what determines a **language**. In other words, the text being passed back and forth is a specific language (**HTML**, as it turns out). The browser and server understand this language. If **we** were to learn it as well, we would be able to command the browser to do whatever we want (ie: we would be able to create webpage layouts).\n\n\n\n\n","idx":5},"deploying-to-the-internets":{"content":"# Deploying to the internets\n---\n\n**Learning objective**: Understand the significance of Git and why GitHub is relevant to our interests.\n\n---\n\nSo at this point, we have a good sense of **how** an HTTP request works, but the main question that remains is this: **how do we get our webpage to the internets?!**\n\nTo answer this question, we must do two things: \n\n1. Build our own simple HTML page\n2. Push it to GitHub.\n\n## Building a basic HTML page\n---\nAt this point, we know that the server from our last section (say, **Google's** server) will return to us a response that is encoded in a specific way (a **language** if you will).\n\nBut! **Where is this data stored?**\n\nAs it turns out, it is stored in files and folders, in the same way we store data on our computers.\n\nSo in order for us to \"build\" our own HTML page, we must do two things:\n\n1. Create a folder to store our HTML data\n2. Create a file **within that folder** and write out HTML.\n\n## Pushing to GitHub\n---\n\nOk, now we have an HTML page! And get this: we can even load it in Chrome and see it rendered! How do we get this online?\n\nIn one word: **GitHub**.\n\n## What is GitHub anyways?\n---\n\nGitHub is a service that allows developers to **push** their local **git repositories** online. As a courtesy, they also have their own server that will **host** HTML/CSS/JavaScript files that are found in the pushed repos.\n\nBut first, a few definitions:\n\n## Git\n---\nGit is an open source software that allows developers to collaborate on large software projects. \n\nWith Git, developers can **commit** code at certain checkpoints. So for example, if you are building a website that requires:\n\n1. a form,\n2. a slideshow,\n3. and a server request, \n\nYou would implement the form then **commit** that code. Then, you would implement the slideshow and **commit**. Finally, you would implement the server requestand **commit** once more. \n\nThis is useful because if, for any reason your updates to the slideshow breaks your form code, you can easily **roll back** to your last commit (the form implementation) and that code would remain pristine and unbroken. \n\n## Git Repository \n---\nWhen you take a piece of code and start tracking it with Git, you are turning it into a git **repository**. Your git repository will store all your commits, keep track of your code, give you commands that allow you to roll back to a previous commit, etc.\n\n## Pushing to GitHub\n---\n\nThe final piece is this: your awesome git repo has let's say 500 commits on it. This is awesome! \n\nBut now calamity strikes! Your computer inexplicably dies the morning of your big presentation. Here's the main question: **are you screwed?**\n\nIn one word: **Yes**. \n\nIncidentally, this is **exactly** the problem GitHUb solves. As it turns out, Git allows you to **push** your git repos to other places. Either your friends computer, or your spare home computer, etc. GitHub is basically a cloud storage system that lets you store your git repos online for **free** and also share it with other developers.","idx":6},"html-basics":{"content":"# HTML Basics\n---\n\n**Learning objective**: Learn the basic structure of a simple HTML page.\n\n\n## Exercise\n---\n\nPlease create a simple webpage and mark up your own resume template. Use **only** pure **HTML tags** and do not worry to much about the styles itself. You may use the **[example](http://resume.taqquikarim.com/)** above as reference.\n\nIf you do not feel comfortable using your own credentials in this exercise, feel free to make up a persona or use a celebrity (ie: **Mickey Mouse**).\n\n\n---\n\n\nHTML stands for **Hyper Text Markup Language**. It is a set of annotations that help parsers (ie: search engines) **understand** the nature of the information that is present on the page.\n\nThink of it like an outline that describes the high level importance of different elements of your webpage.\n\n## Basic setup\n---\n\nYour typical HTML file will look like this:\n\n```html\n<!doctype html>\n<html>\n <head>\n <!--\n the HEAD section of html does not have any content\n that the user can see\n\n instead, we place things like:\n page title\n external css links\n SEO keywords\n here\n -->\n <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n <title>My First Awesome Site</title>\n </head>\n <body>\n <!--\n\n the BODY section will contain all the tags\n that the user can _SEE_ and _INTERACT_ with\n -->\n </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n## Key components\n---\n\n**`<!doctype html>`**\n\nThis tag tells the browser to read our HTML content as HTML5, the latest and greatest revision of the HTML spec. We MUST include it as the first thing on our .html files. I usually type it as all lower case, but it's common practice to also type as: <!DOCTYPE html>\n\n**`<html>`**\n\nThis is the root tag. Basically, all other tags in your html file must live inside this tag. Note how on the bottom of the code snippet, we have a \"\". This is called closing a tag and we must close all tags that we open (with the exception of a few). If we do not do this, our HTML markup becomes invalid.\n\n**`<head>`**\n\nThis section contains content that does not show the user things. Typically, we would expect to see things such as the page title, external links, and SEO tags here.\n\n**`<body>`**\n\nAll the magic happens here. All the tags the user interacts with should live in this tag.\n\n## Commonly used HTML Tags\n---\n\n```html\n<!--\n the h1 - or heading one - will have the most important text on page \n by the old guard, we should really only have one h1 per page\n -->\n <h1>Hello, Wrold</h1>\n\n <h2>This is a h2</h2>\n\n <h3>This is an h3</h3>\n\n <h4>This is an h4</h4>\n\n <h5>This is an h5</h5>\n\n <h6>This is an h6</h6> \n\n <!--\n this is an inline element\n unline the block element, which is meant to provide structure\n the inline element is interpreted as content\n this means that will appear next to one another\n -->\n <strong>This is an inline element</strong>\n <strong>This is another inline element</strong>\n\n <!-- this is a block element so it will NOT be on the same line -->\n <h1>Will this be on the same line?</h1>\n\n <!-- \n\n differences between block elements and inline elements\n block: takes up entire width of page unless otherwise told \n (we don't know how yet)\n we can impose dimensions on block elements\n inline: meant to be content or text\n we cannot impose dimensions on inline elements \n\n -->\n\n <!-- how to add more spaces or line breaks?? -->\n <h1>THIS will have many &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spaces</h1>\n\n <h1>This is <br> Sparta</h1>\n\n <a href=\"http://www.google.com\">Hello, Wrold I'm a link, yo</a>\n\n <!--\n this is one mode\n <tagName attribute1=\"someValue\" attribute2=\"someOtherValue\"></tagName>\n\n this is a self closing tag\n <tagName attribute1=\"someValue\" attribute2=\"someOtherValue\">\n --> \n\n <!--\n convention: \n external links open up in new tab\n absolute URLs\n\n internal links open up in same tab\n relative URLs\n -->\n\n <a href=\"http://www.google.com\" target=\"_blank\">Hello, Wrold I'm ALSO a link, yo</a>\n\n <em>This is an em</em>\n\n <p>This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.</p>\n\n <img src=\"http://placekitten.com/g/200/300\">\n <span>This is a kitten.

These tags are mainly used to dictate structure and meaning to the **information** that is presented on our website.\n\n## Exercise\n---\n\nTake the resume that you built for homework and redefine the content using the **semantic** html elements we will be learning about today.\n\nIf you did not do the homework or just wish to use something else, feel free to use my **[resume](http://resume.taqquikarim.com)**.\n\n\n\n## Properly marking up your page\n---\nDon't worry about what the `id` attributes mean for now.\n\n![site structure](http://i.stack.imgur.com/L4qMt.png)\n\n## Sections VS Articles\n---\nUse **sections** when you are outlining **chapters in a book**. \n\n**EXAMPLE**: A dessert cookbook could have chapters on **cake** recipes vs **pie** recipes.\n\nUse **articles** when you are defining say **poems** in a volume.\n\n**EXAMPLE**: In our dessert cookbook, **each recipe** in the **cake** section would be an **article**.\n\nYou can nest **articles** into **sections** and **sections** into **articles**.\n\n**EXAMPLE**\n\nArticles can go inside section tags\n```html\n<section>\n    <article>\n      <!-- first blog post -->\n    </article>\n    \n    <!-- .... more articles here ... -->\n</section>\n```\n\nSections can also go inside article tags\n```html\n<article>\n  <section>\n     <!-- introduction -->\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n     <!-- content -->\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n     <!-- summary, etc -->\n  </section>\n</article>\n```\n\n**THIS STUFF IS PARTLY SUBJECTIVE; THERE REALLY IS NO ONE RIGHT ANSWER**. As long as we are consistent and don't violate the laws of HTML (ie: we don't put a **p** tag inside a **a** tag, or something like that). \n\n## Headers, Footers, Nav, Main\n---\n\n* Use headers/foorters/navs as **often as you'd like** within each section/article/aside\n* Each sectioning element (section/article/aside) can have it's own `h1` tag (some validators say this is not recommended but this is still technically allowed)\n* I usually put `nav` tags inside the `header` or `footer` pages\n* **MAIN** can only be used once per page. Typically, it is used to define what the main content block of the page is. Don't have to use it though. \n* Essentially, **the blue in the previous image could be wrapped in a main tag**\n\n\n## Semantic HTML5 Tags\n---\n\nHere are some of the main tags that are supported.\n\n**SECTION**: Represents a generic document or application section.\n\n**HEADER**: Represents a group of introductory or navigational aids..\n\n**FOOTER**: Represents a footer for a section and can contain information about the author, copyright information, et cetera.\n\n**NAV**: Represents a section of the document intended for navigation.\n\n**MAIN**: Defines the main content of a document.\n\n**ARTICLE**: Represents an independent piece of content of a document, such as a blog entry or newspaper article\n\n**ASIDE**: Represents a piece of content that is only slightly related to the rest of the page.\n\n## More info on sections vs articles\n---\n\n**SECTION**: Used to either group different articles into different purposes or subjects, or to define the different sections of a single article.\n\n**ARTICLE**: `<article>` is related to `<section>`, but is distinctly different. Whereas `<section>` is for grouping distinct sections of content or functionality, `<article>` is for containing related individual standalone pieces of content, such as individual blog posts, videos, images or news items. \n","idx":8},"practical-css3-guidelines":{"content":"# Practical CSS3 Guidelines\n---\n\n**Learning Objective**: Understand the implementation of CSS3 as a technique for enhancing user experience.\n\n---\n\n\nLet's talk about **CSS**, or **Cascading Style Sheets**, the language that allows us to define styles and adjustments to default content on our webpages.\n\n## Exercise\n---\nTake the resume that you built in the last section and apply a few of the CSS principles we will cover in this section to improve overall user experience.\n\n### Basic Definition\n---\n\nMethod for searching your html tags efficiently and styling the results it finds.\n\n** Three ways to CSS **\n\n1.
